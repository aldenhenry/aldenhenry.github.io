			Introduction
		</h1>
		<p id="introcontent">
			The operating systems is the core software component of 
			our computer. It peforms many functions and is, in very basic terms, an interface between your computer and the outside world. In the section about hardware, a computer is described as consisting of several component parts including our monitor, keyboard, mouse and other parts.

			What is an Operating System?
		</h1>	
		<p id="content" style="text-align:justify; width:100%">
			The operating system is the most important program that runs on a computer. Every general-purpose computer must have an operating system to run other programs and applications. Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard, sending output to the display screen, keeping track of files and directories on the disk, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.<br>
			<br>For large systems, the operating system has even greater responsibilities and powers. It is like a traffic cop -- it makes sure that different programs and users running at the same time do not interfere with each other. The operating system is also responsible for security, ensuring that unauthorized users do not access the system.

			Functions of Operating System
		</h1>
		<p id="content1" style="text-align:justify; width:100%">
			Regardless of the size and complexity of the computer and the operating system, all operating systems perform the same four basic functions:
				<li class="listclass">
					Control hardware access
				</li class="listclass">
				<li>
					Manage files and folders
				</li class="listclass">
				<li>
					Provide a user interface
				</li>
				<li class="listclass">
					Manage applications
				</li>

			Hardware Access
		</h1>
		<p class="content2">
			The OS manages the interaction between applications and the hardware. To access and communicate with each hardware component, the OS uses a program called a device driver. When a hardware device is installed, the OS locates and installs the device driver for that component. Assigning system resources and installing drivers are performed with a plug-and-play (PnP) process. The OS then configures the device and updates the registry, which is a database that contains all the information about the computer.<br>

			<br>If the OS cannot locate a device driver, a technician must install the driver manually either by using the media that came with the device or downloading it from the manufacturer's website.

			File and Folder Management
		</h1>
		<p class="content2">
			The OS creates a file structure on the hard disk drive to store data. A file is a block of related data that is given a single name and treated as a single unit. Program and data files are grouped together in a directory. The files and directories are organized for easy retrieval and use. Directories can be kept inside other directories. These nested directories are referred to as subdirectories. Directories are called folders in Windows operating systems, and subdirectories are called subfolders.

		User Interface
	</h1>
		<p class="content2">
			The OS enables the user to interact with the software and hardware. Operating systems include two types of user interfaces:
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>Command-line Interface (CLI)</strong> - The user types commands at a prompt
						<img class="uipictures" src="commandlineinterface.jpg">
				</li>
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</strong> - The user interacts with menus and icons
						<img class="uipictures" src="graphicaluserinterface.png">
				</li>
		</p>
		<p class="content2">
			A user interacts with software through the user interface. The two main types of user interfaces are: command line and a graphical user interface (GUI). With a command line interface, the user interacts with the operating system by typing commands to perform specific tasks. An example of a command line interface is DOS (disk operating system). With a graphical user interface, the user interacts with the operating system by using a mouse to access windows, icons, and menus. An example of a graphical user interface is Windows Vista or Windows 7.<br>
			<br>The operating system is responsible for providing a consistent application program interface (API) which is important as it allows a software developer to write an application on one computer and know that it will run on another computer of the same type even if the amount of memory or amount of storage is different on the two machines.

			Application Management
		</h1>
		<p class="content2">
			The OS locates an application and loads it into the RAM of the computer. Applications are software programs, such as word processors, databases, spreadsheets, and games. The OS allocates available system resources to running applications.<br>
			<br>To ensure that a new application is compatible with an OS, programmers follow a set of guidelines known as an Application Programming Interface (API). An API allows programs to access the resources managed by the operating system in a consistent and reliable manner. Here are some examples of APIs:<br>
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>Open Graphics Library (OpenGL)</strong> - Cross-platform standard specification for multimedia graphics
				</li>
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>DirectX</strong> - Collection of APIs related to multimedia tasks for Microsoft Windows
				</li>
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>Windows API</strong> - Allows applications from older versions of Windows to operate on newer versions
				</li>
				<li class="listclass">
					<strong>Java APIs</strong> - Collection of APIs related to the development of Java programming
				</li>
